# what is variable :- A variable is a name that refers to a value stored in memory, we can use any name to assign the variable. variable declearation have some specific rules to be flow 

#  Data Types in Python
# Numeric Types:- int, float, complex...
# String 
# Boolean 
# Sequence Types  :- list, tuple, range...
# Mapping Type :- dictionary...
# Set Types :- set, frozenset...
#    

# Practice 
# Create a variable named Use the type() function to check the types of the variables you have created. Create a string variable named greeting and assign it the value "Hello, World!".
# A.Print the length of the string.
# B.Convert the string to uppercase and print it

# example Of data type 
#age = 25        # An integer
#name = "Alice"  # A string
#height = 5.6    # A float
#is_student = True  # A boolean


# Step 1: Variable Creation
# Creating variables for two numbers
num1 = 10        # First number (integer)
num2 = 5         # Second number (integer)

# Step 2: Perform Arithmetic Operations
# Performing operations
addition = num1 + num2           # Addition
subtraction = num1 - num2        # Subtraction
multiplication = num1 * num2     # Multiplication
division = num1 / num2           # Division

# Step 3: Print Results
print("Addition:", addition)            # Output: Addition: 15
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)      # Output: Subtraction: 5
print("Multiplication:", multiplication) # Output: Multiplication: 50
print("Division:", division)             # Output: Division: 2.0


# type() to check the type of data present in variable
# 
DataType_test = type(addition);
print("The data type of this variable is ", DataType_test);
